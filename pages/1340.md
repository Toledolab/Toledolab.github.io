## Course Description
Why do frozen water pipes rupture in the winter? What is an atomic clock and
how does it help us keep time? Why does table salt dissolve in water? How does bleach remove stains
from your carpet? To answer these questions, we must build a fundamental picture of light, matter and the
small particles (atoms) that make up our world. With these tools, students will construct a molecular-level
understanding of chemical bonding, reactivity, and thermodynamics.

## Student Learning Objectives
1. Develop a working understanding of the subatomic composition and properties of elements via the shell model
* [1.1 - Atomic Structure](/1340/1.1/)
* [1.2 - Shell Model](/1340/1.2/)
2. Describe the general composition and reactivity of matter
* [2.1 - Naming Molecules and Compounds](/1340/2.1/)
* [2.2 - Chemical Reactions](/1340/2.2/)
* [2.3 - Solutions](/1340/2.3/)
3. Describe the electronic structure of matter using data and models
* [3.1 - Electronic Structure](/1340/3.1/)
* [3.2 - Bond Energy](/1340/3.2/)
* [3.3 - Molecular Bonding](/1340/3.3/)
4. Describe molecular shape and its impact on molecular interactions
* [4.1 - Molecular Structure](/1340/4.1/)
* [4.2 - Intermolecular Forces](/1340/4.2/)
5. Assess the likelihood of a chemical or physical change based on various thermodynamic quantities (e.g.
enthalpy, entropy, free energy)
* [5.1 - Reaction Forces](/1340/5.1/)
