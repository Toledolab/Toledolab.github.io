    Becca is originally from Evanston, IL, just north of Chicago. 
    She earned her B.A. in Chemistry from Amherst College in 2012 and then worked for two years at a healthcare software company in Madison, WI. 
    In 2014 she moved to back to Chicago to begin her Ph.D. at The University of Chicago working with [Professor Steven Sibener](http://sibener-group.uchicago.edu/). 
    Her graduate research focused on the interaction between gases and solid interfaces, with applications ranging from astrophysical ice 
    formation to the destruction of chemical warfare agents. After receiving her doctorate in early 2020, she joined the faculty at 
    St. Edward's University in Austin, TX as an assistant professor.
