## :key: Key Concepts and Skills 
* **Ideal ("perfect") gases**: Explain the characteristics of an ideal gas and use the ideal gas law to solve for any unknown variable of state (pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of substance)
* **Deviations from ideality**: Clarify why (and under what conditions) real gases will deviate from ideal behavior
* **Compressibility**: Given a gas law or state variables for a gas, solve for compressibility ($$Z$$) and discuss how the resultant function or value of $$Z$$ indicates deviation from ideal behavior
* **Alternative gas laws**: Plot and discuss the features (constants, behavior, etc.) of new gas laws like the Virial or Van der Waals equation. 
* **Critical behavior**: Identify what critical behavior is and calculate the critical constants ($$p_c$$, $$T_c$$, and $$V_c$$) and critical compressibility ($$Z_c$$) for a particular gas or equation of state. Discuss how isotherms above, below, and at the critical temperature correspond to molecular behavior and phase.
