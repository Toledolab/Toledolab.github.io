## :key: Key Concepts and Skills 
* **System and surroundings**: Interpret the meaning of sign (+ or -) on heat, work and internal energy
Path and state functions: Describe the difference between state functions (internal energy) and path function (heat and work)
* **Calorimetry**: Use the principles of constant-pressure calorimetry to calculate heats of combustion
* **Heat capacity**: Leverage the relationship between internal energy, enthalpy, and heat capacities to solve for various quantities. Comment on the relationship between heat capacities for perfect (ideal) and non-perfect gases. 
* **Reversibility**: Compare quantities like “work performed” in reversible and irreversible processes. 
* **Processes**: Calculate the change in internal energy, enthalpy, heat, and work for various processes (i.e. reversible, isothermal compression)
* **Adiabatic**: Relate values of pressure, volume, and temperature in an adiabatic expansion or compression process
* **Exact Differentials**: Manipulate the exact differentials for enthalpy and energy to solve for various parameters and relate to measurable quantities (i.e. Joule-Thomson coefficient)
