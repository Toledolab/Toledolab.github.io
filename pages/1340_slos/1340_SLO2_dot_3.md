## :key: Key Concepts and Skills
* **Solutions**: Define and apply the terms solute, solvent, solution, solubility. Evaluate statements, diagrams and equation representations made about solutions and the process of dissolving
* **Molarity**: Use the relationships between of moles, grams, volume and molarity to calculate the concentration of chemical solutions
* **Dilutions**: Apply the concept of serial dilution to calculate concentrations of stock and dilute solutions.
* **Solubility Rules**: Determine solubility of an ionic compound in an aqueous solution based on the solubility rules.
* **Precipitation Reactions**: Predict products in precipitation reactions, list spectator ions in reactions, interpret models/diagrams depicting dissolution reactions, and write full molecular, total ionic, net ionic chemical equations describing the reaction.
* **Dissolution Stoichiometry**: Given amounts an ionic compound and volume of an aqueous solution, determine the concentration of ions in an aqueous solutions in terms of molarity.
