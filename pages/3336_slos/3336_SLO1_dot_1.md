## :key: Key Concepts and Skills 
* **Phenomenological Gas Descriptions**: Understand the four key variables of state and the associated empirical gas equations of state (Boyle's Law, Charles's Law, Avogadro's Principle
* **Temperature**: Invoke the thermodynamic definition of temperature
* **Kinetic Molecular Theory**: Restate the basic key assumption of kinetic molecular theory, and use the ideal gas law to predict basic behavior of a so-called ``perfect'' gas
* **Boltzmann Distribution**: Interpret and plot the equation for molecular speed distributions and justify important features of the curve and how they depend on temperature and molecular mass. Solve for three key velocities ($$v_{rms}$$, $$v_{mp}$$, and $$v_{mean}$$). 
* **Equipartition Theorem**: Calculate the degrees of freedom associated with a particle/molecule and assign them to either translational, rotational, or vibrational energy. Discuss the relationship between these types of molecular motion, internal energy, and heat capacity.
